# Detecting Flower Species from the Images

**Context:** A potential client approached us asking for a feasibility assessment of their big
idea. They want to build an app in which a user takes an image of the plants in
their garden and the app recognizes the plant, providing them information about
the plants health, care instructions and a possibility to share the image directly to
social media.

**Task:** Your task is to train a quick proof of concept model verifying the feasibility of detecting
flower species in images coming from [this dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html)

**Outcome:** A report concerning the training of the model, including: your decisions and steps you took,
short assessment of the modelâ€™s performance, and the code you used to solve the above.
